# Horse Race Detection
This is a project, designed in collaboration with two other students, focuses on detecting the winner of a horse race
using an implementation of the MASK-RCNN machine learning model for object detection and image segmentation. By
leveraging horse images from the MS COCO dataset and pre-trained ImageNet weights, we trained the model
to recognize horses in different race images. Using PixelLib, the project processes and obtains the coordinates 
of the winning horse, visually highlighting it with a golden color.
