# Horse Race Detection
This is a project, designed in collaboration with two other students, is designed to detect the winner of a horse race.
This project relies on the use of an implementation of the MASK-RCNN machine learning model for object detection and image
segmentation. Using horse images from the MS COCO dataset, as welled as pre-trained ImageNet weights, we trained the model
to recognize horses in different horse race images. Using PixelLib, we processed and obtained the coordinates of the winning
horse and highlight it with a golden color.
